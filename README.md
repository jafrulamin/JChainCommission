## Purpose of Contract

This contract is used to handle preorders for a digital product. Here's how it works:

The seller deploys the contract with the product name, unit price, and a deadline. Buyers can place preorders by sending ETH to the contract before the deadline. The ETH stays locked in the contract.

If the seller marks the product as delivered on time, they can withdraw the money. If the product is not delivered by the deadline, buyers can get refunds.

This is a good use case for smart contracts because it acts like an escrow. The rules are written in code and everyone can see them. You don't need to trust a middleman or a website. The contract automatically checks if the deadline passed and handles refunds.
